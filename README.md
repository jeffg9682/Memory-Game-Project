## Instructions
There are 8 different icons in the game. The object of the game is to match each icon with it's identical tile. 
The game is completed when a player correctly matches all the tiles.
A rating is awarded based on the number of moves & time spent to complete the game.
The is a refresh button to restart the game if needed but it will end the current game & any progress the player has.
Just click the tile to flip the card. If two cards are flipped that match they will stay show, otherwise they will flip back over.
Try to take as few moves as possible to match all cards then you will get a better rank.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
